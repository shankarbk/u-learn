👉 Playbook
👉 ansible.cfg


What is Ansible Inventory?
	- Inventory = Target machines
	
	- Inventory defines WHERE to run automation
	- It is the list of hosts/servers Ansible manages.
	- Tells Ansible which machines exist
	- Can store host/group variables
	
	Example:
		hosts.ini
		---------
		web1 ansible_host=172.20.1.100 
		web2 ansible_host=172.20.1.101 dns_server=10.5.5.4
		web1 ansible_host=172.20.1.102
		
		[webservers]
		web1
		web2
		web3
		

What is Ansible Playbook?
	- Playbook = Instructions to run on those target machines
	
	- Playbook defines WHAT to do on those hosts
	- It is a YAML file that contains tasks, actions, roles, and automation logic.
	- Describes configuration, deployment, orchestration steps
	- References hosts from inventory
	
	Example:
		site.yml
		--------
		- hosts: web
		  tasks:
			- name: Install nginx
			  yum:
				name: nginx
				state: present
				

What is ansible.cfg ?
	- ansible.cfg = Rules for Ansible execution
	
	- Configuration/settings file for Ansible itself
	- It controls HOW Ansible behaves.
	- Sets defaults like inventory location, SSH user, timeout, roles paths
	- Overrides Ansible runtime behavior
	
	Example:
		/ect/ansible/ansible.cfg
		------------------------
		[defaults]
		inventory = hosts.ini
		remote_user = ubuntu
		timeout = 30
		host_key_checking = False
