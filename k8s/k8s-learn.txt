Fundamental Kubernetes Concepts

1. Pod – Smallest unit in Kubernetes, wraps one or more containers with shared network and storage.
2. Node – A worker machine that runs pods and is managed by the Kubernetes control plane.
3. Cluster – A group of nodes working together as a single Kubernetes system.
4. Deployment – Manages the desired state of pods and handles rolling updates.
5. ReplicaSet – Keeps a specific number of identical pods running at all times.
6. Service – Provides stable networking to access a group of pods reliably.
7. Ingress – Manages external HTTP/S access to services using rules and paths.
8. ConfigMap – Stores non-sensitive configuration data separately from container images.
9. Secret – Stores sensitive information like passwords and tokens in a secure way.
10. Namespace – Logical partitioning of cluster resources for isolation and organization.
11. Kubelet – Node agent that makes sure containers described in pods are running.
12. kubectl – CLI tool to interact with and manage Kubernetes clusters.
13. Control Plane – The set of components that manage the overall cluster state.
14. Scheduler – Assigns new pods to suitable nodes based on resource needs and policies.
15. Controller Manager – Runs background controllers to maintain cluster state automatically.
16. Etcd – Distributed key-value store used to persist all cluster data.
17. Taints & Tolerations – Control which pods are allowed to run on specific nodes.
18. Labels & Selectors – Used to group and select Kubernetes objects dynamically.
19. Resource Requests & Limits – Define how much CPU and memory a container needs and can use.
20. Helm – Kubernetes package manager for deploying and managing applications.
21. CRD (Custom Resource Definition) – Lets you define your own Kubernetes resource types.
22. Operator – A controller built to automate complex application operations using CRDs.
23. DaemonSet – Runs a pod on every node or specific nodes in the cluster.
24. Logs & Events – Help you debug and track what's happening inside the cluster.
